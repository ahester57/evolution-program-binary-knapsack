# An Evolution Program

## Objective

Solve the following optimization of the 0/1 Knapsack Problem.

### Given

* Weights, $W_i$
* Profits, $P_i$
* Capacity, $C$,

### Find a binary vector

$$\vec{x} = \langle x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \rangle, x_i \in \lbrace 0, 1 \rbrace,$$

### which maximizes

$$P(x) = \sum_i^n{(x_i \times P_i)},$$

### subject to

$$\sum_i^n{(x_i \times W_i)} \leq C.$$
